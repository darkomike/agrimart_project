# AgriMart 

An agribusiness marketplace built on blockchain.

## Abstract 
Every person in the globe depends on agricultural products for their daily requirements.Given the complexity of the modern agricultural product supply chain and the number of parties involved, it can be challenging to pinpoint some essential details including product origin, seller identity, crop quality, and selling price[2] . In contrast to former years, our proposed system is designed to give producers (farmers) a fair price for their agricultural output. By enticing the nation's enthusiastic youth into agriculture, which is its main source of income, this suggested plan promotes entrepreneurship and market globalization. To promote transparency, traceability, trust, and security of supply chain transactions, our proposed solution integrates blockchain technology with decentralized transactions. We prescribed a smartphone application for secure electronic commerce that uses clear algorithms to record stakeholder interactions in the supply chain that boost confidence between involved parties.

## Problem Statement
The pricing of agricultural items has been observed to be inconsistent in our local marketplaces, giving the purchasers exclusive authority over the prices at the expense of the producers. Additionally, these purchasers proceed to price these goods in accordance with the degree of profit they anticipate from the deal, leading to several pricing anomalies. According to the results of our study, these farmers have no choice but to sell because there is no platform or system in place to control the prices of their agricultural products. 

## Project Aim
The creation and development of a digital marketplace where interested parties can exchange agricultural products at a predetermined standard price is the main objective of this project. The decentralization of the blockchain is the source of most of the proposed system's attributes. These key properties include things like transparency, immutability, traceability, and non-repudiation.
